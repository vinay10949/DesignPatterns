### Template Pattern
Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to defines a skeleton of an algorithm in a base class and let subclasses override the steps without changing the overall algorithmâ€™s structure.

### Conceptual Example
Let's say we have a process that has a series of steps, some of which can be customized by subclasses. The Template Method Pattern provides a framework where the overall process is defined in a base class, but the specific steps can be implemented in subclasses.
